# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
```
```shell
npx hardhat compile
```
```shell
npx hardhat clean
```
```shell
npx hardhat test
```
```shell
npx hardhat node
```
```shell
node scripts/sample-script.js
```
```shell
npx hardhat help
```
